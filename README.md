# Candy_Machine_Tracker

The goal of this project was to track on the Solana blockchain the creation of new "CandyMachine" which are "entities" in the blockchain that are able to create NFTs. Every time a "CandyMachine" was created on the blockchain this little bot goal was to create a new message in one of my discord channels to alert me of it.

Note : The secrets in this repo are already disabled, no need to try to use them. The reason it was pushed on this repo was because this repo was intended to be a private repo and to gain on speed of developing.

After putting it on public I've checked the secrets and disbaled them.
